## • Data cleaning
The preprocessing helps to get a clean dataset, such as removing rows or columns, and adding new features.
Droping rows, first, drop rows with Null value. Second, drop rows with duplicates values. Third, drop rows that contain videos with error, videos with disapplied comments and videos which don't allow rating.
I transformed the number of days to the name of the day, then the code which shows distribution of the number of views on each day.


## • Outliers:
An outlier is an observation that lies an abnormal distance from other values in a random sample from a population. In a sense, this definition leaves it up to the analyst to decide what will be considered abnormal. Before abnormal observations can be singled out, it is necessary to characterize normal observations.
This step was done after visulization.
